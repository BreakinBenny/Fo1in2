{100}{}{You see: Vasquez, the mercenary desperado.}
{101}{}{You see a seedy-looking gunman.}
{102}{}{What do you want?}
	{103}{}{Who are you?}
	{104}{}{Hnn.}
{105}{}{I do not work for the weak of mind. You leave now.}
{106}{}{You have not heard of me? I am hurt! My name is Vasquez Villanova Hernandez Ortega. I am a famous desperado, my friend. And, if you have need, I am a gun for hire.}
	{107}{}{Really? How much do you cost?}
	{108}{}{See you around, maybe. Good luck. Heh.}
{109}{}{Ahh, straight to the point, my friend. Excellent. I will help you around town for a measly 100 caps a week. My services are not cheap, but then again, I am worth it.}
	{110}{}{Great, I'll hire you. Here's 100 caps.}
	{111}{}{Sorry to bother you, but I don't think I need your services.}
{112}{}{I am sorry, my friend, but I do not work for imaginary money. I need cold, hard cash.}

# Floats when in party
{113}{}{Excellent. I am yours. Let us go, this place bores me.}
{114}{}{Lead on, I am yours to command!}
{115}{}{Let us get something to drink!}
{116}{}{Where shall we go first?}
{117}{}{As long as you stay in Junktown, I am yours. I do not like leaving this town.}
{118}{}{Did you know that I have a bounty on my head? It is too small, however.}

# Returning
{119}{}{Ah, my friend. It is good to see you again.}
	{120}{}{I want to hire you for a week.}
	{121}{}{Nice meeting you again.}
	{122}{}{Hnn.}
{123}{}{Well, maybe it is not so good to see you again. Have a good day.}
{124}{}{Of course you do. My bill is small, and my worth is so large. 100 caps, please.}
	{125}{}{Here you go.}

# Damaged
{126}{}{You should not have done that, my soon-to-be-dead friend.}

#Fo1in2
# Map commentary
{151}{}{This is Killian's, a general store. Always has plenty of stock for the likes of us.}
{152}{}{Gizmo's casino. A hive of gambling and underworld activity. Maybe you like it, my friend?}
{153}{}{Need a room to sleep? The Crash House is where you'll get lucky.}
{154}{}{This is the jail. It is very boring, trust me.}
{155}{}{If you are hurt, Doc Morbid can help you. He took one of my teeth a while ago. Still hurts, though.}
{156}{}{Those robed guys, they are new here, and they creep me out.}
{157}{}{You can bet on the fights in the ring. Got me a pretty penny once.}
{158}{}{This is Skullz turf, my friend. We should not be here.}
{159}{}{Need a drink? The Skum Pitt will be open in the evening. We should come back then.}
{160}{}{Ahh, the right place to be right now! Need a drink? You'll get it here at the Skum Pitt!}
{161}{}{Well, this was Skullz turf. Not anymore now.}
{162}{}{Maybe that dog is just hungry.}
{163}{}{Ah ... I'll see you later, my love.}

# Party dialog
{200}{}{My friend, your rodeo is way too big already.}
	{201}{}{I need to change formation.}
{202}{}{What distance do you want me at?}
	{203}{}{Stay close.}
	{204}{}{Keep a moderate distance.}
	{205}{}{Move out to longer range.}
	{206}{}{What sorts of weapon skills do you have?}
{207}{}{I'm a gunman, my friend. I shoot with my pistol!}
	{208}{}{Uh, never mind.}
	{209}{}{Follow me.}
	{210}{}{I need you to wait here.}
{211}{}{If you say so.}

# Healing
{300}{}{My friend, I'm all set.}
{301}{}{Got nothing that'll slow us down, my friend.}
{302}{}{You got anything to help, my friend?}
{303}{}{Hey, maybe you should have a look at this.}

# Pushing
{310}{}{Right. I'm moving.}
{311}{}{Sure thing.}
{312}{}{I'll be over here.}
{313}{}{Relax, my friend.}

# TMA
{970}{}{That is my name.}
{971}{}{My friend, you are talking to me.}
{972}{}{That's me.}

{980}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{981}{}{Sorry. No clue, my friend.}
{982}{}{Never heard of it.}

# Generic Party dialog
	{2000}{}{Let's discuss our combat tactics.}
{2001}{}{Yes?}
	{2010}{}{Draw your best weapon.}
	{2011}{}{Change your armor.}
	{2012}{}{Prefer ranged combat against close.}
	{2013}{}{Prefer close combat against ranged.}
	{2014}{}{Choose distance on your own.}
	{2015}{}{That's all for now.}
{2100}{}{Sure.}
{2101}{}{Sure thing, my friend.}
{2102}{}{Whatever you say, my friend.}

{3500}{}{I'm  sorry, my friend, but I'm about due for some crutches and a wheelchair over here.}
{3501}{}{I'm  sorry, my friend, but I'm glowing like a neon sign over here. Got any anti-radiation drugs?}
{3502}{}{I'm  sorry, my friend, but I got some poison runnin' through my system. Got any antidote?}

# Mariposa prisoner
{3503}{}{Let us go, this place bores me.}
