Fallout 1 Robodog
-----------------

This is a small just-for-fun mod that turns Dogmeat into a Robodog.

### Installation
To use this mod, add the mod folder name to the mods_order.txt file inside the /mods/ directory. If the mods_order.txt doesn't exist, start the game once for it to be created.
