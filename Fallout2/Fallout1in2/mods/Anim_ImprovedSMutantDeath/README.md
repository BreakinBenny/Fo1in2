Improved Death Animations - Animation Fix
-----------------------------------------

This mod increases the size of the "flame boy" and "electrocuted" death animation for super mutant (120%) and power armor (larger than normal, but smaller than mutant-size) critters to match their normal scale.

Originally made by .Pixote. and Sduibek. The animations have been polished up some more and are now cleaner and less pixelated.

Compatible with all FALLOUT 2 mods.

### Installation
To use this mod, add the mod folder name to the mods_order.txt file inside the /mods/ directory. If the mods_order.txt doesn't exist, start the game once for it to be created.
