Fallout 1 - Vault 15 Rework
-----------------

This mod changes the Vault 15 entrance maps to be more in line with the Vault 15 design in FALLOUT 2. Ideas from both games were merged together to create a new, lore friendly blend (80 years before Fo2 begins), without changing the actual gameplay of the location.

### Installation
To use this mod, add the mod folder name to the mods_order.txt file inside the /mods/ directory. If the mods_order.txt doesn't exist, start the game once for it to be created.
