Notable changes since last release ([v1.8.3032](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.8.3032))

- **Added**: Green city circle on the worldmap is a bit less bright green when classic worldmap mode is disabled.
- **Added**: The 9mm Mauser pistol can be converted to the 10mm caliber if Fo2 weapon upgrades are enabled.
- **Fixed**: Crash when using the door inside of Darkwater's shop after killing Killian.
- **Fixed**: Death screen had broken colors.
- **Fixed**: Keri in the Hub wasn't using the sex-macro which tracks the players sex-level.
- **Tweaked**: The Hub Old Town Captors will only attack the player if he actually enters the house. No more unwanted attack from walking past the door that was just opened by a stupid child.
