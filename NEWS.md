Notable changes since last release ([v1.8.3032](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.8.3032))

- **Added**: Green city circle on the worldmap is a bit less bright green when classic worldmap mode is disabled.
- **Added**: New "Expanded Wrecks"-setting to fo1_settings.ini file, which enables more variation in the city encounters (Graphics by Sonora mod). Enabled by default.
- **Added**: The 9mm Mauser pistol can be converted to the 10mm caliber if Fo2 weapon upgrades are enabled.
- **Fixed**: City encounter maps were using 07desert and not 11chilrn as in Fo1.
- **Fixed**: Crash when using the door inside of Darkwater's shop after killing Killian.
- **Fixed**: Death screen had broken colors.
- **Fixed**: It was possible to break the ending slides when entering the crater-locations right after the Cathedral/Mariposa were destroyed. Added a fail-safe and improved the script to prevent this from happening.
- **Fixed**: Keri in the Hub wasn't using the sex-macro which tracks the players sex-level.
- **Fixed**: The refugee in Necropolis would always mention that "some human killed their men" even if the player did not attack Harry & Friends.
- **Tweaked**: "Resting encounter" are now based on vanilla encounter maps, as in Fo1. Disabled the old workaround locations.
- **Tweaked**: All worldmap encounter chances have been adjusted to the Fo1 values.
- **Tweaked**: Hi-Res patch encounter map edges visually improved.
- **Tweaked**: Motorcycle spawn position in mountain encounter maps.
- **Tweaked**: Moved the Necropolis Watershed map around to fix shitty map edges.
- **Tweaked**: The Hub Old Town Captors will only attack the player if he actually enters the house. No more unwanted attack from walking past the door that was just opened by a stupid child.
- **Tweaked**: Vault 15 entrance hi-res patch screen edges.
