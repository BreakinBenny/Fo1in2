Notable changes since last release ([v1.10.3504](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.10.3504))

- **Fixed**: Brahmin poop would always only spawn on map elevation 0.
- **Fixed**: Dogmeat was barking error when crippled.
- **Fixed**: It was possible to sell items to various NPCs before "giving" them via dialog, so they could be stolen back later.
- **Fixed**: The Mother Deathclaw in the Boneyard was printing male instead of female critical hit messages (old Fo1 vanilla bug).
- **Fixed**: Wrong AI package for initial Katja stage.
- **Fixed**: aesthetic fixes to Hunting/Sniper Rifle sprites (from UPU).
- **Fixed**: fallen Brahmin didn't recover on re-entering maps.
- **Fixed**: the text position of ShowLootWeight mod when ExpandInventory=1
- **Fixed**: using alcohol on Brahmin would cripple player's legs (FIXT bug).
- **Tweaked**: All alcohol can be used on Brahmin now.

- **Tweaked**: Deathclaw Spawn critters in caravan job encounters will look like small Deathclaws if Fo2 critters are enabled.
- **Tweaked**: If Fo2 critters are enabled, new Deathclaws in the LA Rippers map will initially be Deathclaw Spawns. After a day, they turn into full grown Deathclaws.

- **Tweaked**: Players can no longer open out-of-bounds merchant boxes.
