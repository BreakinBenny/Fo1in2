Notable changes since last release ([v1.10.3504](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.10.3504))

- **Fixed**: It was possible to sell items to various NPCs before "giving" them via dialog, so they could be stolen back later.
- **Fixed**: The Mother Deathclaw in the Boneyard was printing male instead of female critical hit messages (old Fo1 vanilla bug).
- **Fixed**: the text position of ShowLootWeight mod when ExpandInventory=1
